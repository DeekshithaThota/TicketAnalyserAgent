"1.  Urgency Assessment:
    *   Low urgency should be assigned to issues that do not block functionality.
    *   UI misalignments are generally considered low urgency.

2.  Priority Assessment:
    *   Medium priority should be assigned to UI issues, especially for enterprise customers.
    *   Customer tier and monthly revenue should be considered when determining priority. High-value customers generally warrant higher priority.

3.  Team Routing:
    *   Developers should be assigned to tickets involving visual bugs or code adjustments.
    *   Chatbots are not suitable for resolving code-related issues.

4.  Resolution Time:
    *   For minor UI issues, a resolution time of 4-24 hours is appropriate.
    *   The minimum resolution time should account for quick fixes, while the maximum allows for testing and deployment.1.  Urgency Assessment:
    *   Low urgency should be assigned to issues that do not block functionality.
    *   UI misalignments are generally considered low urgency.

"*   **Urgency:** Low
*   **Priority:** Medium
*   **Team:** Developers
*   **Reason:** The issue is a minor UI misalignment (low urgency). Given the customer is enterprise, the priority is set to medium. The ticket is routed to the developers team since it involves a visual bug.
